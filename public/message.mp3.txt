PLACEHOLDER FOR message.mp3

You need to add a message.mp3 audio file here for the sound notifications to work.

Recommended:
- Short notification sound (0.5-1 second)
- Subtle, pleasant tone
- Low file size for web performance

You can find free notification sounds at:
- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com
- Or record your own

Once you have the audio file, rename it to "message.mp3" and replace this text file.
